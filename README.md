### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zeng Fung. I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Statistics at the University of California, Davis. 


- ðŸŒ± I am interested in the field of machine learning, particularly in finding efficient algorithms that run fast and produce desirable results.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on updating and maintaining [WaveletsExt.jl](https://github.com/UCD4IDS/WaveletsExt.jl), a Julia software package on signal processing that I co-authored under the organization [UCD4IDS](https://github.com/UCD4IDS).
